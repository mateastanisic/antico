This repository is the product of my master thesis "Metaheuristics algorithms for malware detection" on Faculty of Science in Zagreb, Department of Mathematics, The Graduate University Programme in Computer Science and Mathematics.

With **antico** you can generate a model for detecting malware using metaheuristic artificial bee colony programming.
